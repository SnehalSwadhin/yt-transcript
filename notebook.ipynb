       "'In India, in the late 90s and early 2000s\\nwhen someone wanted to buy their first car, they would only go for Maruti 800. If a rich kid has passed some exam, if someone\\'s business was running well, or even someone gets\\nan award for getting married. Everyone used to buy Maruti\\n800 as their first car. Forget about normal people,\\neven people like Sachin Tendulkar, Shah Rukh Khan and Boman Irani they had a Maruti 800 as their first car. And the reason was that the 800 was cheap,\\nand was affordable for people of that economy, and the markets had no special options. But today, in 2025, everything has changed. Today, we have so many options\\nwhich can make us dizzy. And thanks to the IT boom in India,\\nbecause the beginners are making in lakhs. And high-earning individuals,\\nwith their first-year income, they would go for offroaders like\\nThar Roxx or sedans like Virtus. But, I think, though you have\\nmoney earlier than the usual you should not go for these cars\\nwhen you are a first-time buyer. And there are a few reasons.\\new reasons. Like when you are a new driver,\\na big car or a car with blindspots they can get you in trouble. Especially, in congested areas,\\ndriver should have such a car that can maneuver quite easily. Secondly, new car buyers should be careful with the particular model they\\'re buying, they shouldn\\'t be infamous\\nfor their reliability issues, and the brand they\\'re going for,\\nthey should offer decent aftersale service. Because new car owners\\naren\\'t much aware of cars and on top of that, if the service isn\\'t good\\nor face problems due to the reliability, that could completely\\nruin their buying experience. Also, the engine should have decent power, because I think, be it a new driver\\nor an experienced one, everyone should enjoy driving a car. Lastly and most importantly,\\na car should be very safe. especially, this becomes\\nmore important for the new drivers, because they are prone to accidents\\ncompared to experienced drivers. Now that I have discussed\\nimportant point for a new driver, but it\\'s very hard to find\\nall these features in a single car. That\\'s why, in this video,\\nI have featured those cars that come very near as per our requirements. In this video, I have featured cars\\nranging between 5 to 20 lakhs. because, as I said before,\\nfor many people today, price bracket doesn\\'t matter\\nwhile buying their first car. Let\\'s start with smaller cars\\nand move towards bigger cars. I will rate all the cars in this video\\nbased on these 5 important points. But this video\\nis independent of these scores, I am just ranking them\\nfrom small to bigger cars. But yes, I will show you the ranking\\nin the end, based on scores, okay? Let\\'s talk about the first\\nand the car at no. 10, and that is Tata Tiago. This car ranges between\\n5 to 8.45 lakhs ex-showroom price. Tiago is a small car\\nbut it\\'s a small car with safety, and this car is amongst those small cars\\nwhich have earned 4 cars in the Global NCAP. But unlike Maruti cars, which are offered\\nwith 6 airbags even with Alto, you get only 2 airbags in Tiago, and these are what you get\\nfrom base to top variants. But trust me, having more airbags\\ndoesn\\'t mean the car is very safe. I believe the strength\\nof the car chassis matters the most, because in the extreme cases,\\nyour car can deform. I mean, the crash you have on the outside\\nwill have an effect on the inside of the cabin. And this will cause problems\\nto the occupants, which you will find less in Tiago\\ncompared to Maruti cars.s. Then, talking about ease of driving, being a small car it\\'s very easy\\nto drive and maneuver, So, in terms of ease of driving,\\nI will give it a 4.4 out of 5. Talking about the engine performance, this is decent in terms of performance,\\nit\\'s nothing exciting and it will make noise at high speeds\\nbecause it is a 3-cylinder engine. But the good thing is,\\nthe vibrations of this engine, despite being a 3-cylinder,\\nyou don\\'t feel them inside the cabin. I drove two cars with this engine\\nand I think the engine is decently smooth. So, I would give 3.5 out of 5 to this engine. Okay, talking about\\nthe overall reliability, I am not talking about the engine, please note,\\nreliability is just not in terms of the engine, I meant about everything,\\nfrom electronics to the engine. You don\\'t get to see many problems\\nin the small cars from Tata. There might be some niggles sometimes,\\nit\\'s okay, so I will rate it a 3.5 stars. But talking about the service experience, then Tata needs to work a lot\\non their service centers and experience. This is why I would rate\\nthis car 3 out of 5 stars. Well, there are many Tata dealers\\nwho offer exceptional service experience, so I would say if you are going for a Tata car, then go to your nearby\\nservice centers, talk to them, and see how the service quality is, talk to your neighbors, if their experience is okay,\\nthen you won\\'t have any problem either. After the service,\\ntalking about the cost and mileage, thoughout this video,\\nI have chosen only those cars which offer decent mileage, and the service cost is reasonable, I haven\\'t chosen those brands\\nwhose service costs are higher. I won\\'t repeat them. But let me talk about the mileage, the 20 km per liter is the claimed mileage\\nand that\\'s decent for this car. Now you have the total score of this car.\\nThe now you have the total score of this car. The next car on the list is Maruti Ignis. Well, you can go for any small Suzuki car, all of them are good for first-time buyers, but I have special reasons\\nfor choosing Ignis. This small car comes\\nwith 1.2-liter 4-cylinder engine that generates 82 bhp of power. It\\'s not an extraordinary power, but in today\\'s date, in such a small car,\\nto offer a 4-cylinder engine. Most brands offer only 3-cylinder engines, and even most of the cars by Maruti\\nare offered with 3-cylinders only. But the question\\nis what\\'s the use of 4-cylinders? The 4-cylindered engines are smooth. Also, Ignis is a smaller car, weights 850kg,\\nthis engine feels more alive in that. Also, the 4-cylinder engines\\nhave a better initial torque, and they don\\'t stutter at low RPMs. This is why I would give\\nthis engine has a 4 out of 5 stars. Even in terms of reliability,\\nyou know Suzuki is at the top, there won\\'t be any stress. Be it electronics or engine, no stress at all, so I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Their aftersales service is spot on, but it has gotten a little crowded,\\nyou might have to wait to get anything done. But still, we can rate it a 4 out of 5 stars, because they\\'ve made their records. And because this car is just 3700 mm long, driving and parking this is a lot easier. So, I would rate this car 4 stars\\nfor the ease of driving. But there is one factor\\nwhere most of Suzuki cars would fail, and that\\'s where this fails\\nand that is the safety. Global NCAP did a crash test on it in 2022. and they rated this car just 1 star. Though this car comes with 6 airbags, like any other Suzuki car has these days. But like I told you earlier,\\nthe bodyshell matters the most, and the bodyshell of this car\\nwas said to be unstable. That\\'s why you have to think about safety. If you mostly drive in the city\\nand hardly drive on highways, this car can be a good option. So, here is the total score of this car. The mileage of this car is 20 km per liter. And, yes, another thing,\\nyou might get a discount on this car, because compared to other Nexa cars,\\nthis car has been low on sales. So, try to get some discount\\nif you are going for this car. The next car on the list is Hyundai Exter. I have featured Exter\\nin my videos many times. According to me, this is a good car\\nfor first-time car buyers. First, this car comes with\\na 4-cylinder engine that is very smooth, like I told you earlier, and on top of that,\\nthis car has dual CNG cylinder on option, and this might save you money\\nif you go for CNG variants. But this isn\\'t a sporty engine. You can do decent city drives\\nand ocassional Highway runs. This is why I would give its engine 3.5 out of 5. Because this car is a little big,\\nso this might feel a little underpowered. Now if talking about\\nthe reliability and aftersale service, Hyundai cars do well in both aspects, so I would rate this car 4 stars\\nin each aspect. The visibility in this car is decent, and this car isn\\'t that big,\\nso you won\\'t have any trouble driving it, so we can rate this 4 stars here. But safety is a department,\\nwhere Hyundai cars are still falling behind. You get 6 airbags in this car,\\nwhich earns Hyundai cars 5 stars. but body integrity is a part\\nwhere it\\'s still lacking in performance. Like they rated Verna 5 stars in Global NCAP, but the bodyshell was unstable. It\\'s about Verna, talking about Exter,\\nthey haven\\'t done any crash tests on this, so we can\\'t give a rate for it. Well, you can go for Punch instead of this car, that car is safer than this but if you are looking\\nfor a better aftersales service, then you should go for Exter only. So, here is the total score of Exter. Let\\'s move towards the next car, which is an SUV from the sub-4 meter category, I mean, it\\'s the SUV 3X0. This car starts from 8 lakhs\\nand goes up to 15.80 lakhs. I wanted to recommend Nexon\\ninstead of this car. because bet it overall reliability,\\nor service experience, cars from both brands\\nare similar in both aspects. Both cars have some electrical issues, and they don\\'t happen to everyone. I mean both cars will offer\\nsimilar ownership experiences. But I am putting XUV 3XO before the Nexon, and the reason for that\\nis Tata\\'s touch sensitive controls. I believe the interior of Tata Nexon\\nis definitely better than that of 3XO, but I feel the touch pannel\\nthat Tata offered instead of buttons, to control AC and others, that will distract new drivers a lot. because to operate them,\\nyou may have to take your eyes off the road, which is not a good thing for new drivers, they will get distracted\\nand this might cause problems. On the other hand, Mahindra used\\ntactile buttons throughout the dashboard, and even if you look at the steering wheel,\\nyou can find buttons there. That is why this car scores better\\nin terms of ease of driving. If I talk about their engines, both petrol and diesel engines\\nthey offer are very powerful, but you can\\'t expect remarkable mileage\\nfrom their petrol engines, Though the company claims 18 kmph,\\nyou can\\'t get that in real life. That\\'s why I would rate their engines 3.5. Talking about the engines,\\nlet me tell you that if you go for this car, as a first-time car owner,\\navoid the TGDI engines, because these GDI engines,\\nover the period of time tend to collect more carbon deposits\\ncompared to that of normal engines, and this will have a spike\\nin the repair and service cost. Also, they recommend high-octane fuels,\\nwhich will add to your expenses, and you will have to be extra cautious\\nwhile driving these cars every day. This is the reason why\\nI didn\\'t have any car from the VW group, because they only offer TSI engines, which is another name for GDI, or else the Kylaq is a very good car,\\nI would\\'ve put that instead of this car. Well, talking about the safety, this car is very safe\\nand earned 5 stars to its name. So, the overall score out of 25\\nfor this car is on your screen. Let\\'s move to the next car,\\nwhich is the Honda Amaze. After the facelift, the Honda Amaze\\nhas become very premium, be it from the inside or outside. I think this is a very good option\\nfor first-time car buyers because this is not a big size car, it has a great visibility, and you don\\'t have a touch panel\\nin this car to distract you, they\\'ve used physical buttons,\\nbet it\\'s the dashboard or steering wheel. Also, Honda engines are very smooth,\\nyou would get a 4-cylinder V-tec engine, which is not as powerful as a 1.5, but still, it\\'s decent for this car. So, I will have to give this car 4 stars. Then talking about\\nthe overall reliability, it\\'s topnotch, Honda cars won\\'t give you\\nproblems for years, bet it their engines or their other parts. Everything works well. So, I would give it a 4. And, most importantly, Honda\\'s service experience\\nis among the best, compared to those car brands\\noperating in India. Honda doesn\\'t have the crowd, so you can get service done quickly. But talking about the safety, it\\'s previous facelift model\\ngot only 2 stars in the Global NCAP. But if you look at the fact sheet,\\nit\\'s bodyshell has been stable. I mean if the new car goes through\\nthe crash test, it can easily get 4 or 5 stars, because they\\'re offering it with 6 airbags, and they\\'ve improved\\nthe active safety features. So don\\'t focus on the safety ratings, this will have better ratings\\ngoing down the line. At no.5 I have Kia Syros. Again, it\\'s a sub-4-meter car, but it\\'s\\nas spacious as an SUV above the segment. Kia has taken care\\nof the comforts in this car. The seats in this car move quite easily, and they recline as well. And the rear seats\\nalso gets a ventilation option, which even expensive cars don\\'t offer. You can carry so much luggage\\ndue to the boxy shape of this car, and again, Kia installed so many buttons\\non the dashboard to make your life easy. That\\'s why this car should get decent points. But I am a little disappointed\\nwith the engine. Because in the name of the petrol engine,\\nthey only offer you a 1-liter GDI engine, which is powerful for sure, but GDI engines are not for the new owners. But still, I have this car on my list, because people are still\\ngoing for the diesel engines, and you get a 1.5-liter\\npowerful diesel engine. But still, I will cut some points\\nfor not being a naturally aspirated engine. Then talking about the service\\nor about the overall reliability, Koreans are going against the Japanese, niether of them is inferior,\\nyou would love them both. And this car got 5 stars on the safety test\\nwhich Bharat NCAP has rated this car, and they don\\'t disclose the body\\'s integrity. I don\\'t understand\\nwhy don\\'t Bharat NCAP reveal about the bodyshell integrity,\\nwhile others do. This is a big question that we need to ask. Well, coming back to Kia, the company said\\nthey\\'ve strengthened the body, so I would say this 5-star rating is accurate\\nand I would add them here. The next car is Suzuki Brezza. It\\'s almost impossible\\nto not have Breazza on this list because it\\'s a Maruti car, it\\'s reliable,\\nservice quality is decent, so you can\\'t doubt about these. It\\'s a sub-4 meter car,\\nso it\\'s easy for you to park, and the visibility in this car is decent\\nsince it offers you bigger glasses. But there are two reasons\\nthat I am more happy with this car over other brands like Hyundai etc. First, it\\'s the safety,\\nGlobal NCAP rated this 4 stars. Yeah, it was the older regime,\\nbut at least it has 4-star ratings to its name. Secondly, the performance. Apart from this car,\\nyou won\\'t find any cars in this segment, to offer you a bigger engine\\nthan 1-liter or 1.2-liter engine. but Brezza offers you\\na 1.5-liter petrol engine, which will offer you a 99 bhp of power, it\\'s definitely not a performance engine, Kylaq\\'s 1-liter engine produces more power, but the low-end torque\\nthat bigger engines offer can never be matched by not just Kylaq\\nbut by any small engine car with a turbo. And the low-end torque\\nis very important for new drivers. because new drivers\\nstruggle to pull manual cars, but if your car offers a good low-end torque then it\\'s a little difficult to happen. Also, on the mountain roads,\\nthese small turbo-engine cars bother new drivers a lot. It\\'s difficult to pick\\nthis car up from a standstill compared to a decent low-end torque engine. That\\'s why this car makes\\na lot of sense for new owners, and yes, this comes with CNG variants, it\\'s another plus point. So, here you have the total score for this car, and now let\\'s move to bigger cars. Now, I would like to talk about\\nanother Maruti car, that is Grand Vitara. So, interms of reliability, service,\\nand engine performance, it is similar to that of Brezza. But we must have to trim the ratings\\nfor the \"east to drive\" aspect because this car is a little long, and first-time owners will have\\nsome problem to park these kinds of cars. This car is big on the inside\\nand it\\'s a decent family car. Despite being this big,\\nthis car offers an awesome mileage. But this car has a problem with it, and this car didn\\'t go through the crash test. And you can\\'t say anything\\nabout the bodyshell integrity of this car. Well, you get 6 airbags in this car, so for now, you can be happy about that. So, here is the total score of this vehicle. The next car on this list is the Kia Clavis. In India, people still\\nlive in joint families, and when a joint family goes somewhere,\\na 5-seater will feel quite smaller. That\\'s why many people\\nwould go for an MPV as their first car, and more often than not, it\\'s Maruti Ertiga. But Ertiga has earned a taxi car image, which people don\\'t want\\nto associate themselves with. So, I think those people\\ncan go with Kia Clavis or they can go with Carens\\nif they are on a tight budget. Again, like Hyundai, Kia cars are very good\\nin terms of service and reliability. But talking about the engine,\\nthroughout the range of Clavis, most of those variants\\noffer GDI engines only. But only the first two variants\\noffer you petrol engines. and you have diesel engines anyway. So, here you must decide\\nwhich engine is the best for you. But still, I would say, new car buyers\\nshouldn\\'t go for GDI engines. And if you take my opinion,\\nyou can also go for Carens, where most of the engines\\nare naturally aspirated ones. So all other engines are tractable, so I have created them well. But there is one more thing,\\nthis car is a 7-seater. So, new drivers might find it hard\\nmaneuvering it to the rear side, and might find it difficult to park. And another concerning thing with this car\\nis it only has got 3-stars in the crash test? So, here is the total score of this car. And we\\'ll move to the no.1 and the final car, and that is Honda Elevate. This car has a good overall reliability,\\nit comes with a decent engine power, despite being a naturally aspirated,\\nit comes offers 118 bhp of power. Honda has a decent service quality\\nas I already told you, the glass area of this car is very decent, and throughout the dashboard,\\nyou get to see the buttons, they didn\\'t use touch panels. And talking about the safety,\\nElevate has no crash test safety rating, they haven\\'t tested it yet, neither in the Global NCAP,\\nnor in the Bharat NCAP. But, yes, this car is built\\non the platform of the 5th generate City, and the 4th generation of City\\ngot 4 stars in the Global NCAP. But the new City isn\\'t yet tested\\nin the B-NCAP and Global NCAP, but this was tested in the A-NCAP,\\nwhich rated this car 5-stars, and the bodyshell of this car\\nwas said to be stable. So, I believe, even if Elevate is tested,\\nit will secure very good safety scores. So, here is the overall star rating\\nof this car, which we\\'ve rated. I think you will comment down that is why I talk about Elevate\\ninstead of Creta, Seltos, and Kushaq. I told you this in two videos,\\nin the last one and this one, where I\\'ve had this at the top of my list, and understand the reason for that. The main reason to put this car at the front, is this car doesn\\'t come\\nwith a bland NA engine, nor does it come with a TSI engine,\\nwhich is high on performance, this car comes with the best of both worlds, an NA engine, which is made on their V-tec technology, which helps this car make 118 bhp of power, and also, if you are light on your feet,\\nyou\\'ll get a decent mileage. Honda has caught such a sweet spot, neither Hyundai nor Kia,\\nand not even VW group was able to do it. Secondly, Hyundai and Kia\\nare making very good cars which has so many features, still, their bodyshell integrity\\nhasn\\'t been great lately, like we\\'ve seen in Verna. Carens also has a bad safety rating, and they\\'ve not even sent\\ntheir Creta and Elevate to test. So, I am a little disappointed with this and that\\'s why I put Honda\\na little higher than these. But when Kia and Hyundai\\nhave their crash test ratings, especially in Global NCAP,\\nand if they\\'re good, then I would prefer them too. This was today\\'s video. Do like and share this video. And comment down\\nyour favorite car from this list. And let me know if I\\'ve missed any car. And I heard likes\\nwill effect the videos\\' reach. so do like this video. Thank you.'"
